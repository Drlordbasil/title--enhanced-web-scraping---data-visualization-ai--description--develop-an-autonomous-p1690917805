# Enhanced Web Scraping & Data Visualization AI

This project aims to develop an autonomous Python program that utilizes web scraping and data visualization libraries to gather and present information from various online sources. The program dynamically retrieves data, extracts relevant insights, and generates interactive visualizations for users without requiring any local files on their PCs.

## Features

1. **Web Scraping**: The AI program uses the BeautifulSoup library to navigate and extract specific data from websites. It autonomously searches for relevant information based on user-defined criteria, such as news articles, stock prices, product details, or social media trends.

2. **Data Aggregation**: The program collects data from multiple sources and combines it into a structured format. It uses web scraping techniques to extract data from websites, APIs, RSS feeds, or online databases, ensuring a comprehensive and up-to-date dataset.

3. **Sentiment Analysis**: The AI leverages natural language processing (NLP) libraries, such as NLTK or spaCy, to perform sentiment analysis on textual data. It analyzes user reviews, social media posts, or news articles, providing insights into public sentiment using pre-trained models or custom classifiers.

4. **Data Cleaning and Preprocessing**: The program applies data cleaning techniques to remove noise, duplicates, or erroneous records. It also performs data preprocessing tasks, such as data normalization, feature scaling, or encoding, ensuring the data is suitable for analysis and visualization.

5. **Interactive Data Visualization**: Utilizing libraries like Matplotlib, Seaborn, or Plotly, the AI generates interactive and visually appealing charts, graphs, and maps. It enables users to explore the data, identify patterns, and gain valuable insights through intuitive and interactive visual representations.

6. **Real-time Updates**: The program continuously monitors selected websites or RSS feeds for new data, providing users with real-time updates. This feature ensures that the information presented is always current and accurate, giving users an edge in decision-making.

7. **Customizable Alerts**: The AI allows users to set specific criteria and receive notifications when certain conditions are met. For instance, users can track stock prices and receive alerts when a stock reaches a pre-defined threshold or be notified of the release of new articles related to specific topics.

8. **User-Friendly Interface**: The program incorporates an AI chatbot feature, enabling users to interact and request specific data or visualizations. The chatbot provides guidance on available data sources, showcases examples of visualizations, and facilitates an intuitive user experience.
